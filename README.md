# Jobula Rasa

Tabula rasa is a Latin phrase often translated as "clean slate"... When you're ready for a 'clean slate' in your first job or new position, use Jobula to stay organized.

## Goals

Build a tool that will track data about active job applications. We aim to create a tool that soon-to-be and current professionals can use to stay organized during a job hunt. Jobula Rasa's first build will have such features as:

- Job description and company info
- Timeline and Date reminder for follow ups and interviews
- Contact information for company connections
- Resume and Coverletter storage
- Interview notes

## Design
